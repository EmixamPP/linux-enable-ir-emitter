## Camera configurations
All the camera configurations generated by the `configure` or `tweak` commands are saved in `/etc/linux-enable-ir-emitter/`.

The name of a configuration file represents the v4l name of the device (the same as used in `/dev/v4l/by-path/`). Since that name is unique, the configuration will only target the specific device for which it has been created.

### Save
Consequently, these configurations can be saved and restored in a future (re)installation of the system (no matter what the distro) by replacing them inside `/etc/linux-enable-ir-emitter/`.

### Delete
If you want to delete a configuration for a device, you can delete the corresponding file inside `/etc/linux-enable-ir-emitter/`. There is no danger in doing so, after the next sleep, reboot or shutdown, the camera will be reset to its default value.
